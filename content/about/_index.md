## Who I am

I am a second-year [Master of Science in Computational Analysis and Public Policy](https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu/) (MS-CAPP) student at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and Department of Computer Science. I previously graduated from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities with dual degrees in Sociology of law, criminology, and deviance (BS) and Statistics (BA) with minors in Political Science and DirecTrack to Teaching. I am interested in criminal justice (policing, juvenile delinquency, community safety, decarceration, criminal law, Fourth Amendment), K12 teaching and education (esp grades 6-12), public opinion/survey, and US politics (campaigning, voting, public opinion, Senate structure). 


## What I am doing

As a researcher, I focus on policing, juvenile delinquency, and K12. My main areas of interests in policing include community policing, warrior mentality training (and its MN dialect - fear-based training), SWAT raids, police powers defined by the Fourth Amendment, body-worn camera policies, and police reforms. I have opinion pieces published by [*Chicago Policy Review*](https://chicagopolicyreview.org/) (first one: [here](https://chicagopolicyreview.org/2022/01/19/soldiers-to-guardians-transition-to-a-community-policing-model/), second one forthcoming).  

As a data science student, I am passionate about data journalism, the art of data visualization and storytelling. I am skilled in R, Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel with knowledge in machine learning, natural language processing, and statistical analysis. A mixed-method researcher, I am familiar with quantitative (statistics, close-ended survey), qualitative (interview, ethnography, focus group), and community engagement methods. I believe that writing and research are two engines for driving impartial public policies and building community/societal impacts.


## Where I want to go

I am interested in careers, such as:

- Data journalism
- Social science/policy researcher
- Data scientist
- Strategic planner
- Public consulting

at: 
- think tank/researcher centers
- government agencies
- mission-driven non-profits/for-profits
