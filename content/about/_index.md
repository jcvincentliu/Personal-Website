## Who I am

Hi, welcome to Vincent's website. I am a community-centered mixed-method researcher focusing on the criminal-legal system and its intersection with the K-12. As of now, I have been on this path for six years.  Over this time, I learned a lot, worked a lot, and hopefully have somewhat made some contributions to the improvement of society. As a researcher, I am heavily influenced by my early years' volunteering experiences with criminal justice nonprofits in twin cities working with community members, hearing their stories, and advocating for changes. During the process, I realized data-driven research could be a weapon in reforms, which made me a data science and public policy student at U Chicago.  

I am pretty much a 'nerd' who would talk about research with friends as a way to have fun. As a naturalist, I love walking by lake or river, or climbing mountains so much more than visiting museums or appreciating fancy designed buildings. I believe that emotions matter for human beings, although I still feel lonely sometimes. As a male, I sometimes also struggle with finding my definition of masculinity. 

To conclude, I am a soldier, a friend, and a researcher. I dream big and small. 

## What I am doing

As a researcher, I focus on policing, corrections, juvenile delinquency, and school to prison pipeline. Notably, my topics of interests in policing include community policing, warrior mentality training (and its MN dialect - fear-based training), SWAT raids, police powers defined by the Fourth Amendment, body-worn camera policies, and police reforms. Some of my policy writings are shown in [*Chicago Policy Review*](https://chicagopolicyreview.org/author/vincent-liu/). Although my training is in data science, I also have tremendous interest in qualitative methods, such as interviews and ethnography, and believing that both are necessary for deriving an unbiased understanding of problems faced by communities and solving them. For this reason, I consider myself a mixed-method researcher (also I am really not the type of sitting in front of a computer and coding all-day. Instead, I really enjoy talking with people and working with people).

As a data scientist, I find my passion in data storytelling, specifically how to communicate data results with stakeholders through visualizations. I've authored numerous visualization reports and data science blogs in a range of publications on Medium (see my [Medium page](https://jcvincentliu.medium.com)). I believe that impacts only happen when both visualizations and stories are in place. People are not attracted by graphics or stories alone but both. With journalism-like narratives of what people have experienced in the system and professional, ethical, and impact-driven data stories, we could influence the public. Guided by this principle, I have been doing on a lot of practice.
