## Who I am

Hi, welcome to Vincent's website. I am a community-centered mixed-method crime researcher focusing on the criminal-legal system and its intersection with the K-12. As of now, I have been on this path for six years.  Over this time, I learned a lot, worked a lot, and hopefully have somewhat made some contributions to the improvement of society. As a researcher, I am heavily influenced by my early years' volunteering experiences with criminal justice nonprofits in twin cities working with community members, hearing their stories, and advocating for changes. During the process, I realized data-driven research could be a weapon in reforms, which made me a data science and public policy student at U Chicago.  

I am pretty much a 'nerd' who would talk about research with friends as a way to have fun. As a naturalist, I love walking by lake or river, or climbing mountains. In addition to that, I am also a fan of Chinese/English literature and art history, although I would prefer outdoor walking to indoor museum visiting 10 out of 10 times.

To conclude, I am a human, a male, a friend, and a researcher. I dream big and small. 

## What I am doing

As a researcher, I focus on policing, corrections, juvenile delinquency, and school to prison pipeline. Notably, my topics of interests in policing include community policing, warrior mentality training (and its MN dialect - fear-based training), SWAT raids, police powers defined by the Fourth Amendment, body-worn camera policies, and police reforms. Some of my policy writings are published in [*Chicago Policy Review*](https://chicagopolicyreview.org/author/vincent-liu/). Although my training is in data science, I also have tremendous interest in qualitative methods, such as interviews and ethnography, and believing that data-driven (quantitative) and human-centered (qualitative) methods are an integral part of the research mindset and imperative for deriving an unbiased understanding of problems communities today are facing and solving these questions. For this reason, I consider myself a mixed-method researcher (also I am really not the type of sitting in front of a computer and coding all-day. Instead, I really enjoy talking with people and working with people).

As a data scientist, I find my passion in data storytelling, specifically how to communicate data results with stakeholders through visualizations. I've authored numerous visualization reports and data science blogs in a range of publications on Medium (see my [Medium page](https://jcvincentliu.medium.com)). I believe that impacts only happen when both visualizations and stories are in place. People are not attracted by graphics or stories alone but by the combination of both. With journalism-like narratives of what people have experienced in the system and professional, ethical, and impact-driven data stories, we could influence the public and policymakers. Data storytelling or public-facing writing, I am not an expert on either but I am always learning, exploring, and improving.
