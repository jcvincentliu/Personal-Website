## Pie Charts/Donult Charts

* Note: Pie (donult) charts are often highly recommended against within the data science community. However, in professional settings, both charts can offer a good way to show sizes of different categories, **should they be clearly annotated and the number of categories is few** (usually the rule of thumb is <= 5 categories). If the purpose is to compare, I highly recommend using other charts instead. Some good alternatives include bar charts and line graphs.
