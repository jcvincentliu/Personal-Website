1. **Nonprofit Sector In Brief Flex Dashboard and Shiny Portal**:
      
This is the project that I worked on during my summer data science internship with Urban Institute. In this position, I developed a R Shiny portal and a flex dashboard that incorporates a handful of features to enhance user interactivity and expand user choices. Both dashboards incorporate a number of interactive charts and maps. I also created a number of easy-to- helper functions to develop a data acquisition -> data cleaning -> data visualization pipeline and reduce the running time.

$\textbf{packages}$: `tidyverse`, `stringr`, `ggplotly`, `leaflet`, `httr`, `flex_dashboard`, `Shiny`

2. **ACS Cleaning**

I did some simple data cleaning of the American Community Survey data for my writing of the first draft of the Applied Problem-set 2 for the *Data and Programming in R 1* class. I was a TA for this course in spring 2022. 

$\textbf{packages}$: `dplyr`, `forcats`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`

3. **Statistical Analysis of the Police-Public Contact Survey data**:

I conducted some statistical analysis on PPCS data to examine statistical relationships
  between frequency of police stops and arrests and suspects' socioeconomic (age, sex, income), racial, and geo-spatial factors (where they live).

$\textbf{packages}$: `tiydverse`, `survey`
