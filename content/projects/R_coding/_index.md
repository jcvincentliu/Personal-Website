1. **Nonprofit Sector In Brief Flex Dashboard and Shiny Portal**:
      
Projects for my summer data science internship with Urban Institute. In this position, I developed a R Shiny portal and a flex dashboard that incorporates a handful of features to enhance user interactivity and expands user choices. Both dashboards incorporate a number of interactive charts and maps.
