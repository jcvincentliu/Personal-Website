$\textbf{packages}$: `tidyverse`, `stringr`, `ggplotly`, `leaflet`, `flex_dashboard`, `Shiny`

      
2. **ACS Cleaning**

I did some data cleaning of the American Community Survey data for my writing of the first draft of the Applied Problem-set 2 for the *Data and Programming in R 1* class. I was a TA for this course in spring 2022. 

Available at (https://github.com/jcvincentliu/Cleaning-ACS-Education-Data-in-R)

$\textbf{packages}$: `dplyr`, `forcats`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`


3. **Statistical Analysis of the Police-Public Contact Survey data**:

### In $\underline{\textbf{Python}}$:

1. **Public Policies and Public Opinions Behind New York Times News Articles in Four Years**

Final project for the *MACS 31300: AI Applications in social Science* course in which, I scraped the NYT times data in 1971, 1989, 2010, and 2020 and applied a mix of nlp, ml, and dl algorithms to investigate what went viral in those time points and if the popularity of words was triggered by social, political, or judicial events.

$\textbf{skills}$: data cleaning (`pandas`), web scraping (`request`), natural language processing (`nltk`, `gensim`, `collections`), machine learning (`scipy` etc.), deep learning (`Tensorflow`), Google Colab, data visualization (`seaborn`)

2. **Crime in the Hood**

Final group project for the *CAPP 30122: Computer Science with Applications II* class in which I was responsible for creating interactive visualizations that shed light on the crime and food resource situation in Chicago's 77 neighborhoods as well as their trends in recent 20 years. I also supported my teammates' works on web scraping, machine learning (decision tree), and Dash development.
