## What is *'Vincent Says'*
<hr>

'*Vincent says*' is not a special forum or a channel. This is my comfort zone in which I take a break from all the chaos, dreams, and myriad pleasant or unpleasant things. This is the place where I let my emotions flow and where I perform the simplest yet the most powerful art - pure writing, writing with no intentions and probably no audience except for myself. We are trained by the master institution called society to hide ourselves with our mask and exhibit to the outer word only what they wish to see and expect. Life isn't easy, and sometimes all we need is running away from whatever happened in the mundane word and inspecting the true ourselves, the person that we once were and are still dreaming to be. Regardless of the age, I am still that young man who once believed that I could catch the sun. 

(Putting it another way, this is also my writing jam-board)

## Thoughts and Words:

1. This is just life, a continuation of struggles, pains, tears but also loves, joys, and hopes. 

2. "I am not OK but tomorrow will come" -- Medium

3. When I was in undergrad, I believed that I could move the world forward with my works. But now, after so many moments of disappointment, depression, and anger, I am less so. People after people have been fighting for their vision of the dream - equity, justice, and accountability --, and they succeeded but also failed. We changed but we also did not change anything. Can collective action really bring power? I want to know the answer.

4. Crime research, or research of any kind, must exhibit constant courage and the driven belief on the power of the most ordinary people. They are what I am not seeing in many.

5. I often thought that male hormone has a really interesting effect on me. As a man, my outside appearances, voices, and whatever people will notice upon seeing me and hearing me speak, are by no means resembles the common perception of male masculinity. Yet inside, I always have a deeply concealed but strong sense and eagerness of heroism that most men don't share. To a certain degree that I am a devoted follower of the message that men can bleed or sweat but not shed tears. Many times, I will also imagine myself as a solider who battle in the front line of war, who get hurt when protecting my comrades. A war against which? I don't know. I would also imagine myself as the protagonist in an adventure story who bond with his friends in countless almost hopeless and dying situations. I respect scars and believe that scars are men's honors although I am not the fighting/battling type of person. I don't know where this sense of heroism, which has been part of myself since young, comes from. Probably what I described above does not mirror the traditional definition of heroism or masculinity, and that it was me who simply assigned some words to do some explanation. I don't care. It may originate from my very early past (middle school) of craving for friendship, and it may lead me to a brighter future or a hell in which darkness is the only color until the time I can redeem myself and make peace with everything.    --> 

6. Blaming the victim is most miserable thing that the weakest will do.

7. Man, show your courage. That's the most precious characteristic of human beings.
