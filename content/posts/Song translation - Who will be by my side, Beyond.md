## Translation
<div align="center">

Where should I go next, 
Who will stay with me on this blood-paved quest?

Walking astray as I step into future,
I am losing my way

Catching my dream like moth to the flame,
who can understand this craziness?

In this long night freezingly coldness is my only feeling,
escape is all I am capable of 

Once upon a time my dream was still naive and simple,
but now I only found depression and desperation

Silence is my response to disappointment,
the bleeding in my heart!

Just forgetting!
The words that I have said!

From yesterday to today,
time is constantly evolving and so are we

Just be who we are! 
Despite that frustrations may be stronger tomorrow!

Now that I have gotten used to (the disappointment).
I can no longer sense those pains (I once felt)

Leaving all those (feelings) in the past, 
there will be no more hesitations, woo...

---

Who can accompany me,
in this lonely night

Throwing out my loneliness and suffering,
there will be no more darkness whenever you are with me

This quest ends up to no avail,
will whom stay fighting by my side?

When the rainstorm is over,
I will remove the gridlock in my heart

Once upon a time my dream was still naive and simple,
but I now only found depression and desperation

Silence is my response to disappointment,
the bleeding in my heart!

Just forgetting!
The words that I have said!

From yesterday to today,
time is constantly evolving and so are we

Just be who we are! 
Despite that frustrations may be stronger tomorrow!

Now that I have gotten used to (the disappointment).
I can no longer sense those pains (I once felt)

Leaving all those (feelings) in the past, 
there will be no more hesitations

Just forgetting!
The words that I have said!

From yesterday to today,
time is constantly evolving and so are we

Just be who we are! 
Despite that frustrations may be stronger tomorrow!

Now that I have gotten used to (the disappointment).
I can no longer sense those pains (I once felt)

Leaving all those (feelings) in the past, 
there will be no more hesitations

Always on the road!

## Original
**Below is the original lyric (in Chinese):**

前面是那方 
谁伴我闯荡

沿路没有指引 
若我走上又是窄巷

寻梦像扑火 
谁共我疯狂

长夜渐觉冰冻 
但我只有尽量去躲

几多天真的理想 
几多找到是颓丧

沉默去迎失望 
几多心中创伤

只有淡忘 
从前话说要如何

其实你与昨日的我
活到今天变化甚多

只有顽强 
明日路纵会更彷徨

疲倦惯了再没感觉
别再可惜计较什么

---

谁愿夜探访 
留在我身旁

陪伴渡过黑暗 
让我驱散寂寞痛楚

寻觅没结果 
谁伴我闯荡

期望暴雨飘去 
便会冲破命运困锁

几多天真的理想 
几多找到是颓丧

沉默去迎失望
几多心中创伤

只有淡忘 
从前话说要如何

其实你与昨日的我
活到今天变化甚多

只有顽强 
明日路纵会更彷徨

疲倦惯了再没感觉
别再可惜计较什么

只有淡忘
从前话说要如何

其实你与昨日的我
活到今天变化甚多

只有顽强
明日路纵会更彷徨

疲倦惯了再没感觉
别再可惜计较什么

始终上路过
