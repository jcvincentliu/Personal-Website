Where should I go next, <br/>
(and) who will stay with me on this quest?

Walking astray as I step into future
I am losing my way

Catching my dream like moth to the flame,
who can understand this craziness?

In this long night I am only feeling coldness,
escape is all I can do. 

Once upon a time my dream was still naive and simple
but I now only found depression and desperation

Silence is the response to my disappointment,
(the situation) makes my heart bleed.

Just forgetting!
the words that I have said!

From yesterday to today,
We have all changed a lot

Just keep who we are! 
despite that frustrations may be stronger tomorrow!

now that I have gotten used to it (the disappointment).
I can no longer sense those pains (I once felt),

Leaving all those (feelings) in the past, 
there will be no more hesitations, woo...

<hr>

Who can accompany me<br/>
in this lonely night,

Throwing out my loneliness and suffering,
there will be no more darkness when you are with me

This quest ends up to no avail,
who will fight by my side?

When the rainstorm is over,
I will solve the gridlock in my heart. 

Once upon a time my dream was still naive and simple
but I now only found depression and desperation

Silence is the response to my disappointment,
(the situation) makes my heart bleed.

Just forgetting!
the words that I have said!

From yesterday to today,
We have all changed a lot

Just keep who we are! 
despite that frustrations may be stronger tomorrow!

Leaving all those (feelings) in the past, 
there will be no more hesitations.

Just forgetting!
the words that I have said!

From yesterday to today,
We have all changed a lot

Just keep who we are! 
despite that frustrations may be stronger tomorrow!

Leaving all those (feelings) in the past, 
there will be no more hesitations.

I will always be on the road!
