title: "Opinion: Why We Need Community Voices in Legal Dialogues About Policing"
date: 2022-10-03
description: "The recent police killing of Amir Locke in Minnesota raised an alarm on how officers should use force: can officers break into one's home in a no-knock style without a probable cause supporting the imminent necessity of such action? As reflected in many SCOTUS cases, I am arguing there is a clear trend of lacking and ignoring community voices in the judicial system, which fosters unaccountable judicial policies that makes officers who committed crimes walk away without punishment."

George Floyd is well-known among the public, thanks to the media’s relentless report on this case. However, few people may remember the names of other police shooting victims whose lives are just as valuable as Mr. Floyd’s. For public policy students and professionals, we carry the responsibility of understanding the implications behind social events so that we may craft fair and reasonable policies that will move society forward. For we who care about criminal justice especially, it matters to know those names of victims in order to better honor them, memorialize them, and walk in the shoes of Black communities to understand their anger, fear, and expectation for the country. The list of police victims is long and now, we are writing down another name on this blood-stained paper.   

For Black residents in Minnesota, February this year opened with a tragedy. 22 year-old Amir Locke’s dreams of becoming a musician like his father were suddenly cut short. On the morning of February 2, Minneapolis police officers stormed into his apartment. Seven minutes later, he was shot to death. Officers justified their actions by saying the Amir put his hand on the trigger and posed serious threats to their safety. The leaked body camera footage, however, failed to corroborate the officer’s story that Mr. Locke posed any danger. Moreover, the officers woke Amir Locke up while he was sleeping, where he naturally reacted by attempting to protect himself in the situation of a home intruder. Amir Locke protected himself with the gun he legally owned and maintained a license for. 

In the case, MPD officers adopted a no-knock warrant, which distinct from a normal home search, officers would need not to announce their presence or identity before they rushed in with it. However, [St Paul Police Department asserted](https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/st-paul-police-did-not-request-a-no-knock-warrant-in-mpd-death-of-amir-locke/89-ec17a0dd-dc30-4553-a29f-b474bf37237f) that they did not request MPD to use a normal warrant instead of a no-knock warrant. In criminal procedure, a no-knock warrant is designed for special situations where should officers knock first, evidence of criminal activities will be in the risk of being destroyed or that the suspect is likely to inflict greatly bodily harms on officers or innocent outsiders (Samaha 2018). Barely awake, Amir was certainly not intending to wash away any “evidence” nor would he pose any imminent danger to officers. Therefore, from a legal standpoint, it seems 

The case ushered us to ponder one important question: are police officers allowed to behave with impunity in law?

The US criminal justice system was designed by the Founders to balance citizen’s legal right of acting according to their free will and the government’s function of maintaining public safety, for which personal freedom is highly valued in the Constitution that invasions of liberty by a public entity shall only be used in the rarest cases and under the most deliberate considerations (Samaha 2018; Balko 2014, Chapter 2). In the Fourth Amendment, this philosophy could be read as every law enforcement agent must have evidence that a crime is afoot before they stop, frisk, search, or arrest a suspect. That is, police cannot make any move based on their pure instinct or guesses and that what they do must be based on evidence (i.e. "probable cause"). This is the concept of reasonableness, which in the words of one lawyer who gave a guest lecture to my undergraduate criminology class, was “the paramount principle of any court’s judgment”.  

However, officers who acted without reasons are rarely held accountable. In the State of Minnesota, officers indicted for charges, such as domestic abuses or assaults on civilians are often allowed to keep their police licenses so that they can walk away without consequences by leaving their former police department and finding another one. Moreover, because of qualified immunity, which protected criminal officers by arguing that their specific situations haven't been discussed in a preceding case ruling, it's almost impossible to convict an officer who committed killing acts. Ultimately, bad apples received little punishment, and the issue persisted. 

The issue of police unaccountability was partially at fault of Supreme Court rulings in the last century, where SCOTUS Justices stood at the side of officers despite evidence suggested that officers' conducts were improper and unreasonable. In *Graham v Connor*, the influential cases that decides that the "objective reasonableness" principle shall be applied in all situations where the police uses forces, the Court argues that officers' conducts complied with the criminal procedure given the imminent situation (note: *the objective reasonableness test says that the legitimacy of police use of force in a given situation is decided by another officer who has no affair with the case discussed*). However, how was an old person with diabetics and in low blood sugar able to pose dangers to officers, and how could entering a store and leaving within one minute be a "suspicious" act? The reason why the Court decided in this manner could be seen in the words of Justices. In more than one occasions, the Justices said that policing is an dangerous job because officers have to make split-second decisions in their daily duties.           

*Graham v Connor* is not the only case where the Court's favoritism on police officers influenced their final decision. This "subjectivity" could also be seen in many other influential Fourth Amendment cases, such as *Terry v. Ohio* (1968), *Adams v. Williams* (1972), and *Kuha v. City of Minnesoka* (2003). 

There is an easy fix for this systematic problem: bringing community voices to the judicial process. Community members should be more than witnesses whose roles are telling judges, prosecutors, and public defenders what they saw, heard, and knew about the case. They should player stronger roles in the decision-making processes of courts at all levels. The reason is simple: because courts' rulings will have direct impacts on lives of community members, communities should have a say in the procedure as well. State and federal courts should invite community leaders, representatives of community members, scholars to an issue committee that is responsible for advising the judges/justices. Because not all judges or justices may be familiar with the issues, for example, some judges/justices' backgrounds may be in commercial laws instead of criminal laws, the issue committee will fill the void by telling justices what studies've found about the issue and what benefits and costs may arise, should they decide the case in one way or another. The issue committee could also be beneficial for the Supreme Court. Notwithstanding these people may not be familiar with constitutions or Amendments as much as justices, their opinions can offer justices new perspectives and usher them to interpret legal doctrines in a more objective way. 

With the issue committee, there will also be a higher level of public trust on the judicial branch and stronger public perception of the legitimacy of important criminal justice institutions since community members can see how their opinions are represented in case decisions. Although very little research has been done on this topic, it is possible that this approach will achieve similar effects as the community policing model - [more communicative, higher trusts, less recidivism, and lower unfairness](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/100705/learning_to_build_police-community_trust_3.pdf). Indirectly, the model will also increase judicial transparency and accountability, reduce biases and racial discrimination in decision makings, and shut down the distance between judicial officials and the communities they swore under the oath to serve.         

I want to wrap up this article with these two asks: what would a good judicial system look like and how we can reach that end.
