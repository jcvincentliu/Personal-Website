Ricky ultimately shot his friend in drunk, which destroyed the lives of both persons. Based on a true story, what the song describes is beyond Ricky but that it mirrors the experience of millions of young adults in the nation."

Ricky was a young boy, he had a heart of stone

Lived nine to five and he worked his fingers to the bone

Just barely out of school, came from the edge of town

Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down, no  
兜里揣着小刀用来战斗，这样就没有人可以把他打倒。没有人。

He had no money, no

No good at home

Walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone

Tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline
