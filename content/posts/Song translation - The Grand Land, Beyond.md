## Translation
<div align="center">

<!--To move to a new line, tab two spaces and press enter-->

--- VERSE---

On those greenery and vibrant land,  
it was once dyed by myriad bloods and tears

On that aged and frowned face,  
wind and frost once stayed

days passing by in laughs and drinks,  
it was my teenager years  
(*Note here the direct translation of the original words is "autumn wind and autumn rain". Here I translated it to "laugh and drinks" to make it closer to its real meaning*)

The unexpected but determined leave happened in a rush,  
I didn't even bid farewell

---CHORUS---

Thinking back the day when I was standing before the gate in that 'alienated land',  
the feeling of lamentation emerged in my heart slowly as I sighed  
All this time, sun set and sun fell. Never changed.

This moment as I am gazing at my father's smile,  
I stopped talking without even realizing it. There is only silence.  
The twilight gradually filled my teary eyes.  

---VERSE---

On those paths toward development and more openness,  
countless dreams and ideals are trodden on and shattered

On those faces of whom sit on top of (power),  
how many histories have been decided and witnessed  
(*Note here, the direct translation would be how much has been proven/referenced. My personal understanding of this sentence is that these peope who are in power shaped the country and decided the history*)

The external sun and moon,   
In coexistence, they empathize each other 

The grand lands that are temporarily 'separated',  
a manually-drawn line set the boundary.

---CHORUS (REPEAT*3)---

Thinking back the day when I was standing before the gate in that 'alienated land',  
in my sighs, the feeling of lamentation emerged in my heart   
All this time, sun set and sun fell. Never changed.

This moment as I am gazing at my father's smile,  
I stopped talking without even realizing it. There is only silence.  
The twilight gradually filled my teary eyes.

---VERSE---

在那些苍翠的路上  
历遍了多少创伤  
在那张苍老的面上  
亦记载了风霜  
秋风秋雨的度日  
是青春少年时  
迫不得已的话别  
没说再见  

---CHORUS---

回望昨日在异乡那门前  
唏嘘的感慨一年年  
但日落日出永没变迁  
这刻在望着父亲笑容时  
竟不知不觉的无言  
让日落暮色渗满泪眼  

---VERSE---

在那些开放的路上  
踏碎过多少理想  
在那张高挂的面上  
被引证了几多  
千秋不变的日月  
在相惜里共存  
姑息分割的大地  
划了界线  

--- CHORUS (REPEAT*3)---

回望昨日在异乡那门前  
唏嘘的感慨一年年  
但日落日出永没变迁  
这刻在望着父亲笑容时  
竟不知不觉的无言  
让日落暮色渗满泪眼  
回望昨日在异乡那门前  
唏嘘的感慨一年年  
但日落日出永没变迁  
这刻在望着父亲笑容时  
竟不知不觉的无言  
让日落暮色渗满泪眼  
回望昨日在异乡那门前  
唏嘘的感慨一年年  
但日落日出永没变迁  
这刻在望着父亲笑容时  
竟不知不觉的无言  
让日落暮色渗满泪眼
